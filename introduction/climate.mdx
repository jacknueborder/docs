### Carbon Cycle

Earth has a natural carbon cycle that helps keep our planet in a **habitable temperature range**.

### Unintentional Disruption

Humans **unintentionally disrupt** the carbon cycle by burning **carbon-based fuels** like coal, oil, and gas.

### Earth Warms Up

Burning these carbon-based fuels **overloads the carbon cycle.** This causes the planet to **warm up.**

### Small Change, Big Trouble

Even a **small change impacts hundreds of millions of lives and costs trillions.**

*   **Extreme weather events** like stronger storms and worse floods.
*   **Shortages** of food and water, rising sea levels that threaten coastal communities.
*   **Property damage** from disasters.
*   **Infrastructure failures** like roads and power lines.
*   **Higher costs** for everyday goods and business losses.

### No Stop Sign

Focused on **next quarter's profits**, most companies don't have strong reasons to **significantly cut their carbon emissions.**
